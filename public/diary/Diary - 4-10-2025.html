      This past week has been rather insane and fruitful for my film-going
      habits, consisting of international films from all around the world. The
      film week started with Miroirs No. 3 directed by Christian Petzold, which
      has only recently dawned upon me that the title is referring to the act of
      projecting that the characters throughout the film do, not dissimilar to
      Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. Along with every other film, I've watched
      this week, it's the first film I've watched from Petzold. Based on it, I
      can say that he is a minimalist director, not only in terms of the film
      length itself, but also in the film's form as well, including the
      characters, plot, and staging, which were relatively straightforward.
      Ambiguities come up within the film through the dynamics between the main
      character, Laura (played wonderfully by Petzold regular, Paula Beer)
      alongside Betty and her family. Without spoiling more details, the film
      centers itself around grief and loss of loved ones, as well as what we do
      to cope with them. While the short duration can be limiting since I feel
      those aforementioned ambiguities could benefit an additional 20 minutes or
      so to flesh them out even further, I believe the film is still a really
      good experience, though maybe not the best introduction to Petzold's
      works.
